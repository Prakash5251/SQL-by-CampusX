    " - A database is a shared collection of logically related data and description of these data, designed to meet the information needs of an organization.  \n",
    " \n",
    "  ### Data Storage: \n",
    "   - A database is used to store large amounts of structured data, making it easily accessible, searchable, and retrievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Data Analysis: \n",
    "   - A database can be used to perform complex data analysis, generate reports, and provide insights into the data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  ### Record Keeping: \n",
    "   - A database is often used to keep track of important records, such as financial transactions, customer information, and inventory levels.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  ### Web Applications: \n",
    "   - Databases are an essential component of many web applications, providing dynamic content and user management."

    "           \n",
    "   - 2. NoSQL Databases -  \n",
    "           - These databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, images, or videos. (MongoDB).  \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  3. Column Databases -  \n",
    "           - These databases store data in columns rather than rows, making them well-suited for data warehousing and analytical applications. (Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery).\n",
    "           \n",
    "   - 4. Graph Databases -  \n",
    "           - These databases are used to store and query graph-structured data, such as social network connections or recommendation systems. (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - 5. Key-value databases -   \n",
    "           - These databases store data as a collection of keys and values, making them well-suited for caching and simple data storage needs (Redis and Amazon DynamoDB)."

    "      - 1. Super Key -\n",
    "              - A Super key is a combination of columns that uniquely identifies any row within a relational database management system (RDBMS) table.\n",

    "              - From the candidate keys, one is chosen as the primary key.\n",
    "              - A candidate key is a minimal Super key, meaning it has no redundant attributes. In other words, it's the smallest set of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify a tuple (row) in the table.\n",

    "      - 3. Primary Key -  \n",

    "      - 5. Composite Key -  \n",
    "              - A composite key is a primary key that is made up of two or more attributes. \n",
    "              - A composite key is a combination of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a record.\n",
    "              - Unlike a primary key, the individual columns in a composite key may not be unique.\n",

    "       -  6. Surrogate Key -  \n",
    "              - A surrogate key is an artificially generated key, often a numeric or alphanumeric identifier.\n",

    "                - A foreign key establishes a link between two tables.\n",
    "                - It refers to the primary key of another table and is used to create relationships between tables.\n",
    "                - It ensures referential integrity, maintaining consistency between related tables.      \n",
